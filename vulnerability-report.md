### Vulnerability 1

#### Exposure SQL Injection

Any user can push SQL into file uploads and it will execute as SQL code and as a shell script.

#### Repair SQL Injection

The vulnerable files are views.py, . We changed the curs.execute() to use ORM methodolgy, preventing any kind of SQL injection.

### Vulnerability 2

#### Exposure Broken Authentication

### Vulnerability 3

#### Exposure Cross Site Scripting

We thought there was a possible XSS vulnerability with the username, but after significant testing, we were unable to run anything.

### Vulnerability 4

#### Exposure Insecure Direct Object References

Most views do not have authentication required.

### Repair Insecure Direct Object References

We added this to several of the views, but not all, please have the developer check our work and update the permissions of each function in views.py .
